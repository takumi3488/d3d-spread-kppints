# d3d-spread-kppints

**This library is incomplete.**

Extends point cloud data within the convention zone with D3d symmetry to the first Brillian zone.

Given `x y z energy` as standard input, it returns this point and all points symmetric to it in the form `x y z energy`. All `x y z` are reciprocal lattice vectors, with one period as the unit.
